# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Tabitha O'Melay]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Sept 06, Sunday, 2020].

## Log

### day 0/99
Worked through the last third of the lessond on freecodecamp for Responsive Web
Design & completed project 1/5. https://codepen.io/tabbykatz/pen/xxVpWOw
### day 1/99
FreeCodeCamp asked me to build a functional survey form and I might've been in 
a mood: https://codepen.io/tabbykatz/full/BaKJxMo (2/5)
### day 2/99
I said initially that I wouldn't count school work for the challenge but... that was a mistake. I spent the entire day coding for school. We're at the RESTful API stage of an airbnb clone project and I might even be "getting it"!
### day 3/99
With a deadline approaching, I worked on airbnb clone most of the day. (Managed to fiddle around a bit with the "product landing page" project from #freeCodeCamp as well!)

Refactoring code in the clone has me wondering if "review" is even a word?
### day 4/99
Today is the last day of my airbnb project, but I also got in time on #freeCodeCamp and refreshed my Vim knowledge at openvim.com
### day 5/99
PLD for RESTful API. Some free code camp, not much.
